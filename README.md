Visualization index
-------------------
This repo is a visual index the default visualizations included with the [Lightning](http://github.com/lightning-viz/lightning) visualization server. Each visualization is an [`npm module`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=lightning-visualization). Standard images and thumbnails are also stored here for external use.

Want to make your own visualization? Read the instructions [here](). If you've made something you like, feel free to submit a PR to add it to the defaults here.
